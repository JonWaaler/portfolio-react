              Passionate programmer with 5+ years of experience in C# and C++. Began web development in 2021 at 
               <a href="https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/coding/" rel="norefferer" target="_blank">University of
               Toronto's Coding Bootcamp</a>. I have significant experience working in groups and collaborating 
               with teams on <a href="https://github.com/JonWaaler?tab=repositories" rel="norefferer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
               What gets me excited about coding is: trying to replicate something that I already enjoy, creating 
               challenging projects without fear of failure (thatâ€™s how we continuously improve) and lastly, 
               making something out of those random thoughts (what if there was something that did this...!).
